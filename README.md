## Installation

For full installation instructions, see the [Github 
wiki](https://github.com/OpenTreeMap/otm-core/wiki/Installation-Guide).

Alternatively, you can also use the [otm-vagrant 
project](https://github.com/OpenTreeMap/otm-vagrant) to get started. 
While not recommended for production, otm-vagrant greatly simplifies 
getting a development environment for testing and contributing to OTM locally.

### Environment variables
This project requires several environment variables, to provide API keys for several services.

```
ROLLBAR_SERVER_SIDE_ACCESS_TOKEN=....
GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY=...
```
`ROLLBAR_SERVER_SIDE_ACCESS_TOKEN` is a token for [Rollbar](rollbar.com).
`GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY` is a browser key for the Google Maps Javascript API, [which can be obtained here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).

## Other Repositories

This repository (ie, otm-core) is but one of a few separate repositories 
that together compose the OpenTreeMap project. Others include:

* [otm-tiler](https://github.com/OpenTreeMap/otm-tiler) - map tile 
server based on [Windshaft](https://github.com/CartoDB/Windshaft)
* [otm-ecoservice](https://github.com/OpenTreeMap/otm-ecoservice) - ecosystem 
benefits calculation service
* [otm-ios](https://github.com/OpenTreeMap/otm-ios) - An 
OpenTreeMap client for iOS devices.
* [otm-android](https://github.com/OpenTreeMap/otm-android) - An OpenTreeMap client for Android devices.

## Additional Documentation

The REST API that provides data for the native mobile apps is documented in [api.md](doc/api.md)

### Deprecated Repositories

OpenTreeMap has a long history. These repositories still exist, but are 
deprecated and no development is happening here moving forward.

* [OpenTreeMap](https://github.com/OpenTreeMap/OpenTreeMap) - Otherwise 
known as "OTM1", this is previous generation codebase of OpenTreeMap. It 
has been entirely superceded by this repository and the others 
listed above. However, there are some live tree map sites still running 
on the old OTM1 code, and so we have left it up for archival purposes.

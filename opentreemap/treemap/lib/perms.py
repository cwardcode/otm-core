"""
Tools to assist in resolving permissions, specifically when the type of
the thing you are checking against can vary.

When it is simple enough to add a model.can_do_thing method to
models.py, you should do so. However, when the same permission logic
is being executed on varying types, like User, InstanceUser, Role, use
this module as a dispatching service.

It seems likely and beneficial that all permission checking move to
this module over time.

CAVEATS:
Perm checking is complicated by several factors. Helper methods live
on several models, and auxilary functions live in template_tags,
object_caches, and probably views in the multiple packages.

    The main permission testing function. This function should
    be called from exported (non-underscore) helper functions.

    role_related_obj can be a Role or InstanceUser (Add more types as needed)

    model_name is a ProperCamelCase string name of the model to test.

    predicate is the function used to set the minimum requirement for
    present permissions to pass the current test. Should be any, all,
    or a custom value.

    perm_attr is the minimum permission value necessary to consider
    the perm present in this context. Should correspond to an attr
    on the FieldPermission class.

    field/fields is the fields to use in conjunction with predicate and
    perm_attr.

    "all of {'image', 'thumbnail'} have ALLOWS_WRITES"
    "any of {'id', 'mapfeature'} have ALLOWS_READS"

Hi %(addressee)s,

Thanks for using %(site_name)s! \
We recently upgraded to the newest version \
of the OpenTreeMap software that powers the \
site ("OTM2"). We noticed there were multiple \
accounts created in the old site for your email, \
"%(email)s". This is not permitted in OTM2, so we \
have merged the activity of your multiple accounts \
onto one, "%(otm2_username)s". If you have any difficulty \
signing in, please contact us at %(contact_email)s.
